# HTML Installation & Setup

Let's get our hands dirty and start preparing to write some code. In this tutorial, we will install VS Code and some related extensions for faster and more efficient HTML development.

## **What are the prerequisites to learning** HTML?

I can safely say that there are **no prerequisites to learning HTML**. HTML is the language of the web and is often the first step that web developers take in learning to code.

### **Tools needed to make an HTML page:**Â 

1) **HTML Editor:** It's a straightforward tool where every piece of HTML content must be written. You can use any text editor of your choice. In this tutorial, we're using Visual Studio Code because it's lightweight and open-source.

Popular editors for HTML development include text editors like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Online platforms like [MSK Web Editor](https://jsfiddle.net/ "MSK Web Editor") are also commonly used for quick HTML editing and testing.

> **Note: You can write HTML even in a Notepad. Text editors like VS code make these things easier.**

2) **Browser:** HTML tags are not displayed by browsers; instead, they are read and interpreted to render the web page. In a web browser, HTML structures are displayed in a styled and visually appealing form. In this tutorial, we are using Google Chrome. Other commonly used browsers include Chromium, Firefox, Safari on Mac, and Microsoft Edge.

## **Installation & Setup of Visual Studio Code for HTML:**

We will install and set up HTML to optimize its utility for creating web pages. Additionally, we'll install extensions in Visual Studio Code to enhance its functionality. If you're unsure about which editor to use, you can confidently start with Visual Studio Code. You won't regret it; it's one of the best free code editors available in the market.
