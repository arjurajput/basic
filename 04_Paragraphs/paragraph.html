Subject : Leave Application for two Days.

Respected sir/madam

With due Respect, I beg to say that I am a student of class 10th in your school. I am not feeling well today and also have some weakness. Hence I request you to please grant me two days leave.

I hope you will consider my application. I will definitely try to remain present after 2 days.

Thanking you.

Yours obediently
