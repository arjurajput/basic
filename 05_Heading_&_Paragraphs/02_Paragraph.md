># Paragraphs `<p>` 
>
>A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text. <br>
>The `<p>` element defines a paragraph. A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (`margin`) before and after a paragraph.
>
>## [Example](paragraph.html)
>```html
><p>MSK Institute is best for coding classes</p>
><p>And Computer Courses</p>

>## Horizontal Rules `<hr>`
>The `<hr>` tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule. <br>
>The `<hr>` element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
>
>```html
><h1>This is heading 1</h1>
><p>This is some text.</p>
>
><hr>
>
><h2>This is heading 2</h2>
><p>This is some other text.</p>
><hr>
>```
>The `<hr>` tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no Closing `</>` tag.

>## Line Breaks `<br>`
>The HTML `<br>` element defines a line break. <br>
>Use `<br>` tag if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
>```html
><p> This is <br> a paragraph <br> with line breaks. </p>
>```
>The `<br>` tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

>## Preformatted text `<pre>` 
>The `<pre>` element defines preformatted text. <br>
>The text inside a `<pre>` element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
